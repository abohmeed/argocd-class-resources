1. Create a directory called `stable` inside the `onepageserver` directory.

2. Move the `onepageserver.yaml` file to the `stable` directory.

3. Open the file and change all the occurences of the `http-server` to `http-server-stable` you can use `vim` command for this:

   ```bash
   :%s/http-server/http-server-stable/g
   ```

4. Change the conents of the configmap to reflect that this is the stable release.

5. Save the file.

6. Add, commit, push, tag, and push tags:

   ````bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Creates the stable release"
   git push
   git tag 2.0.0
   git push --tags
   ````

7. Go to the terminal and duplicate the `stable` directory in the onepageserver directory:

   ```bash
   cp -pr stable canary
   ```

8. Inside the Canary directory, change all the occurrences of `http-server-stable` to `http-server-canary` using `vim`

9. Change the configmap content to reflect that this is the Canary release.

10. Add the following annoations to the ingress object:

    ```yaml
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "40"
    ```

11. Commit and push the changes to the remote repository with a tag:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Introduces the Canary release"
    git tag 2.0.1
    git push
    git push --tags
    ```

12. Modify the `onepageserver.yaml` in the `argocd` directory to look as follows:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ApplicationSet
    metadata:
      name: onepageserver
    spec:
      generators:
      - list:
          elements:
            - release: stable
              revision: 2.0.0
            - release: canary
              revision: 2.0.1
      template:
        metadata:
          name: '{{release}}-onepageserver'
        spec:
          project: default
          source:
            repoURL: https://gitlab.com/abohmeed/samplegitopsapp.git
            targetRevision: '{{revision}}'
            path: 'onepageserver/{{release}}'
          destination:
            server: https://192.168.2.36:6443
            namespace: default
    ```

13. Push this to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Introduces Canary deployments to the application set"
    git push 
    ```

14. Go to the UI and refresh the application set. Sync the stable and the canary deployments and wait till they are ready.

15. Wait till the sync is finished and go to the application page on 192.168.2.36.

16. Refresh the page several times to show that the Canary release appears a few times.

17. Modify the ingress file to make the Canary release 60%.

18. Apply the change to git moving the tag to the latest release:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Increases the Canary deployment percentage to 60%"
    git tag -a -f 2.0.1 # Add a message like: Moves the Canary tag
    git push --delete origin 2.0.1
    git push 
    git push --tags
    ```

19. Go to the Argo CD UI and refresh and sync the Canary release
