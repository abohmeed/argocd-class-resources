[your username]" --password "[your personal token]"
```
* Create the Argo CD directory by running the following commands:
```bash
mkdir argo-cd
cd argo-cd
```
* Create the Nginx installation file as follows:
```yaml
# nginx.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
    name: nginx
    namespace: argocd
spec:
    project: default
    source:
        repoURL: 'https://gitlab.com/[your username]/samplegitopsapp.git'
        path: manifests
        targetRevision: main
    destination:
        server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
        namespace: default
    syncPolicy:
    automated:
        selfHeal: true
        prune: true

Apply the manifest to the cluster as follows:
```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```
Go to the UI and view the applications. Make sure that the sync status is OK. Go back to the terminal and view the running pods and services:
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```
Create a Git workflow as follows:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/increase-replicas
# modify the deployment replicas to be three
git add base/deployment.yaml
git commit -m "Inreases the replica count"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/increase-replicas
```
Go to Gitlab by copying the link from the output message of the above command. Approve and merge the MR.
Go back to the terminal and run the following:
```bash
argocd app sync nginx
